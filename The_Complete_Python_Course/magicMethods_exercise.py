# We have a class called Club, and it is initialized like this (no need to change):
class Club:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.players = []

    # define a method that allows us to access the i-th player in the club directly via indexing.
    # for example, if some_club is an object of Club class,
    # we can access the i-th player in some_club like this (you may assume i is always valid):
    # some_club[i]
