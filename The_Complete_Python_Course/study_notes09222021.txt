honestly, break down codewars prompts so you understand what you have to do. that's the biggest gap I see so far
but also
go back and re-study loops and functions
what makes me say this is
from what you wrote above, it means you don't have a good grasp of where/when to use loops yet

loops are for iterators: lists, strings, etc
it wouldn't work on a variable that's just a single number
I mean techincally it would
but it would just print 1 number
so these are the kind of things I'm trying to highlight, which are important to understand

so these are the kind of things I'm trying to highlight, which are important to understand
if you have x_count =[0,1,2,3,4,5]
you can iterate through that with a for loop
or 'abcdef'
you can run through that too
